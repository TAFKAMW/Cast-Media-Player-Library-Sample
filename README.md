# Cast-Media-Player-Library-Sample

This sample shows how to use the Media Player Library. It is not a UX complete
sample. It shows how to hook up the library with the receiver api.

## Dependencies
* None

## Setup Instructions
* Get a Chromecast device
* Upload the receiver.html to a website that can be accessed from your Chromecast. Later, when you publish your application, you will need to host so that it is accessible using HTTPS.
* Register an application on the Developers Console (http://cast.google.com/publish). Enter the URL for your receiver application. DON'T PUBLISH YOUR APP.
* If you haven't already done so, please register the serial # of your Chromecast device in the developer console as well.
* Using the Chromecast setup application, make sure [x] send your serial number to Google is checked.  This is the only way that you can access your unpublished receiver.  While your in the Setup application, make a note of the IP address of your Chromecast. It will be helpful later if you wish to use the Chrome Remote Debugger.
* 15 minutes after you have updated the developers console, you should reboot your Chromecast, so that it picks up the changes.
* Enter the App ID of your receiver application into your sender application or one of our sample sender applications, such as DemoCastPlayer.
* You should now be able to launch your receiver using a sender.
* If you wish to watch whats going on, using a Chrome browser, connect to &lt;IP of your Chromecast>:9222 and debug your receiver.  A good place to start is looking at the console log.
* The Media Player Library uses XMLHTTPRequest to load all assets (Manifests,
sub-manifests, segments, crypto keys, etc. This means that these are subject to CORS rules.  You asset server(s) will need to server CORS headers that enable
access to all versions of your receiver. (development, staging, and production)
